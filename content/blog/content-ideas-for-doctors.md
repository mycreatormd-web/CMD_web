## Never Run Out of Content Ideas Again

One of the biggest challenges for medical content creators is knowing what to post. Here are 10 proven content formats that work across platforms.

## The 10 Content Ideas

### 1. Myth Busters

Debunk common health myths in your specialty. People love learning that what they "knew" was wrong.

**Example:** "3 things you've been told about [condition] that aren't true"

### 2. Day in the Life

Show your audience what your typical day looks like. This humanizes you and satisfies curiosity.

**Example:** "What a day in the ER really looks like"

### 3. Explain It Simply

Take a complex medical concept and explain it so anyone can understand.

**Example:** "How vaccines work, explained in 60 seconds"

### 4. Before/After or Case Studies

Share anonymized case studies or transformations (with appropriate consent and privacy).

**Example:** "How this patient's life changed after [treatment]"

### 5. Behind the Scenes

Show the parts of medicine people don't see—the training, the teamwork, the challenges.

**Example:** "What happens in the operating room before surgery"

### 6. Q&A Sessions

Answer questions from your audience. This builds engagement and trust.

**Example:** "Answering your most asked questions about [topic]"

### 7. Current Events Commentary

Share your professional perspective on health news and trends.

**Example:** "A doctor's take on [current health topic]"

### 8. Tips and Lists

Practical, actionable advice that people can use.

**Example:** "5 things I wish every patient knew before their appointment"

### 9. Personal Stories

Share your journey—why you became a doctor, challenges you've faced, lessons learned.

**Example:** "The patient who changed how I practice medicine"

### 10. Collaboration Content

Partner with other medical professionals for different perspectives.

**Example:** "I asked a [specialist] about [topic]"

## Making These Ideas Work

### Batch Your Content

Set aside time to create multiple pieces at once. This maintains consistency without daily stress.

### Repurpose Across Platforms

One idea can become:
- A long video
- A short clip
- A carousel post
- A thread
- A blog post

### Keep an Idea Bank

When inspiration strikes, write it down. You'll thank yourself later.
